# DSA Revision Platform

A web app to track and revise DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) questions by topic and difficulty. Save problems from LeetCode or anywhere, get random practice, and see what’s due for revision.

## Features

- **Question bank** – Add questions with topic, difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard), and link
- **Search & filter** – Search by text, filter by difficulty, sort by topic, date, or difficulty
- **Stats** – Total count and breakdown by difficulty; “due for revision” count
- **Due for revision** – Questions not revised in 7+ days; “Random (Due)” for focused practice
- **Mark as revised** – Track when you last revised each question
- **Random problem** – Pick a random question or one due for revision
- **Auth** – Email/password and Google sign-in; forgot password
- **CRUD** – Add, edit, delete questions; data synced with Firebase

## Tech Stack

React, React Router, Firebase (Auth + Firestore), CSS.

## Firestore rules

The repo includes [firestore.rules](firestore.rules): only the authenticated user can read/write their own `users/{userId}/questions` and `users/{userId}/settings`. Deploy with Firebase CLI: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` (after linking the project).

## Setup

1. Clone and run `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com) config
3. Run `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
